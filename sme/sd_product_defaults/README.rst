Product Defaults module
========================


A new module is created named sd_product_defaults.

When a user will create a new Product or a Product Variant, He will have the Internal Reference and Barcode fields populated automatically.

In Settings > Inventory, A new section is added named "Auto-Sequencing"

In this section we have have added 3 new tickboxes:
    

    1. "Create Product Internal References Automatically" - if ticked then show the "Internal Reference" sequence as clikcable to go to the Sequence page
    2. "Use Auto-Created Internal Reference as Barcode" - if ticked then the Product Barcode field should be populated from the Internal Reference field and the "Create Product Barcode Automatically" tick box should be unavailable (greyed out)
    3. "Create Product Barcodes Automatically" - if ticked then show the "Product Barcode" sequence as clickable to go to the Sequence page


New products or product variants when created will follow these new rules.
    
Thanks.
